1. Download the source

2. Run python bootstrap.py -d
   Note:
     - The -d command tells bootstrap to use distribute, easy_install's 
       successor
     - If you want to run your project with a different version of python
       than your default, specify that when you run the bootstrap command. 
       IE: python2.4 bootstrap.py -d

3. Run bin/buildout
   Note: This will get all your project's dependencies listed in your 
         setup.py file.


4. You'll want to move the multiselect/media folder and its contents to a
   place your static media url can see. Be sure to update widgets.py to point
   to the right directory.


HOW TO USE:
Just set your form field to use the MultiSelect widget and make sure you include the form media in your template

DEPENDENCIES:
a jquery theme:
  multiselect/media/css/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui-1.7.1.custom.css

JQuery https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.4/jquery.min.js
JQueryUI https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.6/jquery-ui.min.js

Note: We disabled some of the options like draggable and sortable because
they didn't seem to work well and I didn't like the animations anyways.
