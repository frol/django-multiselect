1. Change the src/django-project folder to be the name of your project.
2. Update the buildout.cfg file so the eggs location under the [buildout] setting points to your project file.
3. Run python bootstrap.py -d
   Note:
     - The -d command tells bootstrap to use distribute, easy_install's successor
     - If you want to run your project with a different version of python than your default, specify that when you run the bootstrap command. IE: python2.4 bootstrap.py -d
4. Run bin/buildout
   Note: This will get all your project's dependencies listed in your setup.py file.
