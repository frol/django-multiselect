1. Change the src/django-project folder to be the name of your project.

2. Update the buildout.cfg file so the eggs location under the [buildout] 
   setting points to your project file.

3. Run python bootstrap.py -d
   Note:
     - The -d command tells bootstrap to use distribute, easy_install's 
       successor
     - If you want to run your project with a different version of python
       than your default, specify that when you run the bootstrap command. 
       IE: python2.4 bootstrap.py -d

4. Rename your project folder if you want (src/project).
   If you do, you'll need to change the name in a couple other spots.
   - In the setup.py, make sure the console_scripts entry point points 
     to your new folder
   - In src/project/settings.py make sure the ROOT_URLCONF points to your 
     folder: 'project.urls'

5. Run bin/buildout
   Note: This will get all your project's dependencies listed in your 
         setup.py file.

Just like that, you're up and running and ready to develop and application 
using django and buildout.

In the django tutorials where you see ./manage.py [command] just replace 
it with bin/manage [command].

The benefit of using buildout is that it allows you to keep your 
development environment controlled so anyone can pick up your project and
have all the dependencies. Plus, it gives you the added flexibility of 
using different versions of different modules for various projects instead 
of having only one installed on your computer.
